          <p class="project-title">Logo Design</p>
          <p>Ewaka, which means <i>home</i> in Luganda, is a lifestyle brand focused on African empowerment and strengthening cultural identity. The center focus of the logo is the joining of the hands which symbolizes unity and partnership. The diversity of the African continent brings together an array of cultures and tradition, and Ewaka symbolizes just that.</p>

          <p class="project-title">Symbol Design</p>
          <p>The theme of this symbol design is based on Thor, the god of thunder from Norse mythology. The design is geared towards the members of the gaming community, in esssence, youth and young adults. The use of solid shapes, and contrasting white lines make it appealing to this particular audience. In Norse culture, red symbolizes power and strength which further represents the main theme of the design. The Midgard serpent is portrayed in dark brown, which is represents the soil, in essence, the Earth. Brown is also associated with wood, an element that was used in abundance in the Viking Age. The Scandinavians were known for using wood in combination with stone to build their homes, boats and tools.</p>

            <p>The goal for this assignment was to create a layout for a four-page newsletter. The design is clean and airy and to add a sense of movement, the nameplate is inspired by the Om symbol. The same design is used in the inner pages of the newsletter. They are placed at the top and bottom of each inner page to create a continued sense of movement. The colour palette composed of cool tones similar to the ones found in the logo. The design is intended for a mature audience.</p>

            <p class="project-title">Event Branding</p>
            <p>For this project, the goal was to create a fictional event and brand it from start to finish. Pamoja, which means together in Swahili, is in its first edition bringing together the works of over eighty contemporary African artists. Showcasing at the Shaw Centre, its mission is to expose the Canadian market and target audience to an area of the art world that is rapidly growing. The event is targeted at art enthusiasts, collectors, students and art professionals. The design is intentionally minimal, geometric and modern. Black and white are the central colours, with a bold addition of gold to bring the design together. These are colours often used in African textiles which is also the inspiration behind the artwork as a whole.</p>

            <p>I have always been inspired by African spirituality and for this assignment I chose to illustrate a well-known orisha (or goddess) from the Yoruba tradition–Oshun. I used coloured leads and ink on 8x10 illustration board.</p>

            <p>Everyone loves a good selfie! Teenagers are renowned for taking selfies in all sorts of places, particularly while working out. This campaign is centered around the selfie an invites the consumer, in this case, the teen, to do just that—take a selfie while working out at Movati.The theme is playful, youthful and colourful. In order to attract the attention of the target audience the colours are eye-catching and minimal use of text is applied. The illustration is the essence of the campaign as it portrays the general theme and sparks the curiosity of the target audience—in this case, the teen.</p>
